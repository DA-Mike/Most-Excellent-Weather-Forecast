# Most Excellent Weather Forecast

The Most Excellent Weather Forecast is a dashboard which will allow the user to search for weather conditions for most, if not all, cities located in the US. The dashboard provides current conditions and a five day forecast. The dashboard saves up to 10 prior searches to allow the user to easily go back and review conditions at a prior city.

Please note that it appears the UV Index data coming in from the API provider doesn't appear accurate, although the color scheme will change based on the UV Index value.

This project was an excellent introduction to utilizing server-side APIs. My motivation for this project was becoming more familiar with utilizing server-side APIs, parsing response data from API calls, and turning that data into useful information that's very intuitive for the app user.

I utilized JavaScript, jQuery, bootstrap, moment.js, and others to successfully complete this project. Full disclosure, I did cannibalize some html/css framework from a previous lesson since the layout was so similar (you'll see comments pointing out what's not mine), but in the end I feel like I made it my own. I also changed the background color from the original mockup as having the box slightly covered helps with contrast.
